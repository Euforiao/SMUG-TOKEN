    <!-- What is SMUG -->
    <section id="about" class="section section--card">
      <h2>What is SMUG?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>SMUG – The StreetMug Token</strong> is a digital asset born
        from real street experience, not a boardroom. It connects Muggers
        (people collecting support in the real world), supporters and
        referrers into one transparent, urban Web3 ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is simple: give people on the edge of the system a tool to
        receive crypto support, tell their story and build a small but real
        digital presence – without pretending to be something they are not.

      <h2>SMUG token utility</h2>
      <p>
        SMUG is not just a speculative ticker. Within the StreetMug platform
        it can be used to:
      </p>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>unlock premium visuals and styles for Support Boxes,</li>
        <li>boost visibility in rankings and community highlights,</li>
        <li>reward helpful behaviour and technical support inside the community,</li>
        <li>participate in small governance decisions and feature votes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        Core parameters (chain, exact tokenomics and launchpad details) will
        be announced publicly once the infrastructure and community reach a
        stable first stage.

  <h2>Team (Concept)</h2>
  <div class="section-tag">
    Real story • Lean team • Web3 native
  </div>
  
  <p>
    StreetMug wasn’t created in an office. It was born in real life — in a moment
    when reality was sharp, cold and unforgiving. Instead of giving up, the idea
    appeared to turn raw street experience into a tool for people living outside
    the system. Born from crisis, from struggle, from the need to stand up again.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Behind the project stands one person — with vision, determination and a story
    that can’t be faked or manufactured. This is the foundation of StreetMug:
    authenticity over marketing, truth over appearances.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Supporting the creation process is a modern AI layer — not as a “team member,”
    but as a production tool that accelerates development: code, design, structure
    and iteration. AI doesn’t replace the human element — it amplifies speed,
    organizes ideas and helps move from concept to prototype.
  </p>
  
  <ul class="bullet-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Street Lead (Human)</strong> — vision, direction, identity,
      creative decisions and the energy rooted in real-life survival and insight.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>AI Layer</strong> — technical and creative support: code sketches,
      architectural suggestions, design concepts, process acceleration and workflow stability.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="note">
    StreetMug remains lean, fast and brutally honest. The team will grow
    organically together with the community — foundation first, people later,
    never the opposite. This is not a corporate startup. It's a project born
    from life, empowered by technology and built for those who rarely get a voice.

      <h2>Launchpad Pitch</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>SMUG – The StreetMug Token</strong> is a new category of
        community-driven asset that merges Web3 with the reality of street life.
        The project was created from authentic experience, not marketing – aiming
        to give people living “on the edge” a simple tool to receive crypto
        support, build a profile and have their own digital voice.
      </p>

      <p>The StreetMug platform allows users to:</p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>create Support Boxes (QR + wallet + goal),</li>
        <li>send and receive gift packs,</li>
        <li>climb and compete in community rankings,</li>
        <li>build reputation and identity inside the ecosystem.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>SMUG</strong> powers the entire system: unlocking features,
        rewarding users, boosting visibility and enabling lightweight governance.
        It is a social Web3 tool for real people – not another hyper-financial startup.

        The project grows slowly and organically. No fake promises, no
        guaranteed profit, no forced hype. Just real people, real streets and
        a shared attempt to turn experience into something constructive.
